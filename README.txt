Dependency Injection - Inversion of Control

        • Inversion of Control
            - A development pattern that involves removing the responsibility of instantiating its dependencies from a class.

        • Dependency Injection
It's a way of achieving inversion of control: an external component instantiates the dependency, which is then injected into the 'parent' object. It can be implemented in various ways:
Constructor
Instantiation class (builder / factory)
Container / framework"
